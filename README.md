# Sentiment-Based-Product-Recommendation-System-for-E-Commerce
#Project Overview

In todayâ€™s fast-paced e-commerce industry, customer satisfaction heavily depends on personalized and relevant product recommendations.
This project simulates a real-world use case for an e-commerce company, Ebuss, where the goal is to enhance the product recommendation process by integrating Sentiment Analysis with a Recommendation System.

The system leverages customer reviews and ratings to understand user preferences, predict sentiments, and recommend products that align with user interests and positive feedback trends.

#Goal

Perform Sentiment Analysis on customer reviews to classify opinions as positive or negative.

Build and compare multiple ML models to identify the best-performing sentiment classifier.

Develop and analyze User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering systems.

Combine sentiment scores with recommendation outputs to suggest top-rated and sentiment-positive products.

Deploy the end-to-end model with a Flask-based interactive user interface.

#Key Concepts

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text cleaning and preprocessing

Feature Extraction: TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or Word Embeddings

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Naive Bayes

Collaborative Filtering: User-Based and Item-Based recommendation engines

Model Integration: Filtering top 5 products from top 20 recommendations using sentiment scores

Deployment: Flask-based UI for real-time user interaction

#Project Workflow

Data Sourcing & Sentiment Analysis

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns.

Applied text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.

Used TF-IDF Vectorization to convert reviews into numerical features.

Trained and evaluated ML models to classify review sentiments.

Building the Recommendation Engine

Created User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF & IBCF) models.

Selected the best-performing approach based on similarity computation and performance metrics.

Recommended top 20 products for each user based on historical ratings.

Integration with Sentiment Model

Filtered the top 5 products with the most positive sentiments from the recommended 20.

Enhanced recommendation precision and customer satisfaction through sentiment-weighted filtering.

#Deployment

Developed a Flask web interface:

Input: existing username

Output: top 5 personalized product recommendations

Deployed the model end-to-end to simulate a real-world e-commerce application.

ðŸ§© Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Flask

Tools & Techniques: EDA â€¢ Text Preprocessing â€¢ Feature Engineering â€¢ Model Evaluation â€¢ Web Deployment

ML Models: Logisitc Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayers

Recommendation Systems : Item Based Recommendation System, User Based Recommendation System

ðŸ“Š Results & Insights

Among the sentiment analysis models tested:

Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy and F1-score, making it the best choice for text classification.

Between the two recommendation techniques:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UBCF) performed better in capturing user preferences.

By integrating the sentiment scores:

Recommendations became more contextually accurate, focusing on products with higher user satisfaction.

The final system successfully provides:

Top 5 sentiment-optimized product recommendations per user, improving personalization and engagement.

ðŸ’» Flask Interface Preview

Input: Username

Process: System retrieves top 20 recommended products â†’ applies sentiment filter â†’ returns top 5 positive items.

Output: List of 5 best-suited products displayed on the UI.

ðŸš€ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning and NLP can work together to create a powerful, sentiment-aware recommendation system.
It provides valuable insights into customer behavior and enables e-commerce platforms to deliver smarter, more personalized shopping experiences.
